      is the phenomenon where one
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene" id="mouseover5">gene</a>
      controls for more than one phenotypic trait in an organism. Antagonistic
      pleiotropy is when one gene controls for more than one trait, where at
      least one of these traits is beneficial to the organism's fitness early on
      in life and at least one is detrimental to the organism's fitness later on
      due to a decline in the force of natural selection.
